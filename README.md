## About

Heaven3D is a from-scratch 3D game engine written in Python on top of [ModernGL](https://github.com/moderngl/moderngl), giving direct access to the OpenGL Core profile. No Panda3D, Unity, Unreal, or GameGuru under the hood: the renderer, physics, editor, importers, audio, and gameplay systems are all written specifically for Heaven3D.

The whole engine ships as a single file, `Heaven3D.py`, so it is easy to read, hack on, and bundle into your own projects.

## ✨ Features

### Rendering
- **Deferred renderer** with a G-buffer (positions, normals, albedo, material, full-colour emissive)
- **HDR float framebuffers** with **ACES filmic tone mapping**
- **PBR materials** (Cook-Torrance GGX, metallic-roughness workflow) with editable emission
- **Forward transparency pass** for true alpha blending
- **SSAO**, **screen-space reflections**, **bloom**, and **PCF soft shadows**
- **FXAA 3.11** (full Quality path) stacked with **4x hardware MSAA**
- **Procedural day/night sky** and animated volumetric-style clouds, on by default in every scene
- **Procedural ocean** using Gerstner waves, with Beer-Lambert absorption, fresnel sky reflection, sun glint, foam, and CPU-mirrored wave heights for buoyancy
- Sun, point, spot, and ambient lights
- Geometry instancing for shared meshes and materials

### Physics (pure CPU, no extra dependencies)
- Rigid bodies with **box, sphere, capsule, plane, heightfield, and triangle-mesh** colliders (mesh colliders use the node's exact triangles, so low-poly buildings with interiors just work)
- Sequential-impulse solver with friction and restitution
- Broadphase sweep-and-prune, persistent contact manifolds, and simulation islands
- Raycasts, overlap queries, triggers, and collision events
- Fixed-step simulation
- Kinematic **CharacterController** with sliding, slopes, step-offset, and jumping
- Colliders and rigid bodies can be assigned to any mesh straight from the Inspector

### Editor
- Built-in scene editor with Inspector / properties panel
- Transform gizmos, light gizmos, spawn gizmos, view gizmo, and a visual collider shape editor
- Procedural terrain generation
- **Building editor**: generate, paint, or manually place modular building sectors on a 2 m grid with a snapped ghost preview, across 5 biomes
- Save and load projects as JSON (`.heaven3d`)

### Gameplay
- **Blueprint system**: attach reusable behaviours to any scene node
- Ready-made blueprints you can attach and play: `FPSController`, `Weapon`, `Projectile`, `Health`, `EnemyAI`, `EnemyFlyShooter`, `Pickup`, `Spawner`, `MovingPlatform`, `TriggerZone`, `LevelEndTrigger`
- **Audio**: 13 built-in synthesised sounds, your own `.wav`/`.ogg` files, 3D positional audio, and music; silent-safe on machines with no audio device
- **HUD**: crosshair, bars, text, and vignette for in-game UI

### Asset import
- **glTF / GLB** (via `trimesh`)
- **OBJ + MTL** with texture resolution
- **Blender `.blend`** files read directly by parsing the Blender file format (no Blender install required)

### Performance
- Optional **Numba** acceleration for hot paths, with automatic, bit-identical fallback to plain Python if Numba is unavailable

## 📦 Requirements

- Python **3.10+**
- A GPU and driver supporting **OpenGL 4.6 Core**

Install the core dependencies:

```bash
pip install moderngl pygame pyglm numpy numba
```

Optional, for GLB/glTF import:

```bash
pip install trimesh
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lolgg313/Heaven3D.git
cd Heaven3D
```

### Editor mode

```bash
python Heaven3D.py
```

### Play mode

```bash
python Heaven3D_runtime.py
```

### Standalone runtime

Runs `game.heaven3d` from the current folder with no editor UI and no gizmos:

```bash
python Heaven3D.py --runtime
```

### Command-line options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--runtime` | Run in standalone runtime mode (no editor UI) |
| `--project PATH` | Load a specific `.heaven3d` project file |
| `--width N` / `--height N` | Window size (default `1690` x `950`) |
| `--no-splash` | Skip the boot splash |
| `--splash` | Force the full first-run welcome splash |
| `--reset-welcome` | Show the welcome splash again on next launch |
| `--version` | Print the engine version |

## 🎮 Minimal FPS Example

```python
import glm
from Heaven3D import HeavenEngine, SceneNode, FPSController, Weapon

eng = HeavenEngine(mode="runtime")

ground = eng.add_cube(size=1.0, name="Ground")   # solid by default
ground.scale = glm.vec3(50, 1, 50)               # collider scales with the node

player = SceneNode("player", parent=eng.scene.root)
player.position = glm.vec3(0, 1, 0)
eng.attach_blueprint(player, FPSController)
eng.attach_blueprint(player, Weapon)

eng._begin_play()
eng.run()
```

Playing a sound:

```python
eng.audio.play("shoot")          # built-in synthesised sound
eng.audio.play("explosion.wav")  # your own file
```
